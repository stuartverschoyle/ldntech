<p class="au"><span class="ap">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="av"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="an"><org value="NEX:APOL" idsrc="xmltag.org">Apollon Formularies Plc</org>&nbsp;(AQSE: APOL)&nbsp;("Apollon"&nbsp;</span></span><span class="an">or the<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;"Company")</span>, a <location value="LC/gb" idsrc="xmltag.org">UK</location> based international pharmaceutical company trading on the <org>Aquis Stock Exchange</org> is pleased to announce that its medical cannabis formulations were shown to be effective in killing both hormone-resistant and hormone-sensitive prostate cancer cells in 3D cell cultures in third party independent laboratory testing. ¬π This finding is in addition to the results recently announced on <chron>May 18</chron>, 2021¬≤ that Apollon formulations were successful in killing HER2+ breast cancer cells, and the announcement on <chron>June 28</chron>, 2021¬≥ that Apollon formulations were successful in killing triple-negative breast cancer cells. This testing was performed under a joint testing agreement&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">with Aion Therapeutic Inc.&nbsp;(CSE: AION)&nbsp;("Aion")</span>,a BC based international pharmaceutical company trading on the Canadian Securities Exchange.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="av"><span class="an">The medical cannabis formulations were developed by&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"><org>Apollon Formularies Jamaica Limited</org> ("Apollon Jamaica")</span>. </span></p>
<p class="av"><span>Prostate cancer is the second most frequent malignancy, after lung cancer, in men worldwide, counting 1,276,106 new cases and causing 358,989 deaths, which equates to 3.8% of all deaths caused by cancer in men, in 2018. The incidence and mortality of prostate cancer worldwide correlate with increasing age, with the average age at the time of diagnosis being 66 years. Of note, for <org>African American</org> men, the incidence rates are higher when compared to White men, with 158.3 new cases diagnosed per 100,000 men and their mortality is approximately twice that of White men. ‚Å¥&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="av"><span>According to a recent report published by Fior Markets, the&nbsp;global prostate cancer treatment market&nbsp;is expected to grow from <money>USD 7.22 billion</money> in 2019 and to reach <money>USD 10.67 billion</money> by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 5% during the forecast period 2020-2027. </span><span>‚Åµ</span></p>
<p class="av"><span>The testing was performed by BIOENSIS, an independent, pre-clinical predictive pharmaceutical testing laboratory. The testing results showed that Apollon Jamaica's medical cannabis formulations were effective in killing living hormone-sensitive and hormone-resistant prostate cancer cells directly (direct cytotoxicity). The formulations killed nearly 100% of the prostate cancer cells in 3D cell cultures. </span><span>‚Å∂</span></p>
<p class="av"><span>The testing occurred as a part of a Joint Testing Agreement between the parties and was authorized in accordance with Apollon Jamaica's Research &amp; Development licence issued by the Jamaican government's <org>Cannabis Licensing Authority</org> (CLA). </span></p>
<p class="av"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span><person>Stephen D. Barnhill</person>, M.D., CEO of Apollon,&nbsp;commented,</span></span><span>&nbsp;"Cannabinoids have been seen to exert 'antitumor' effects by a number of different means, including killing cancer cells directly as well as inhibiting transformed cell growth and tumor metastasis.</span><span> ‚Å∑</span><span> Apollon Jamaica, using results from its proprietary artificial intelligence-based analysis on strain genetics, has cultivated and processed certain of its proprietary medical cannabis products with cancer treatment expressly in mind. We are extremely excited that our proprietary medical cannabis formulations have been validated via independent laboratory testing to kill both hormone-sensitive and hormone-resistant prostate cancer cells in 3D cell cultures via direct cytotoxicity. This is in addition to &nbsp;our Apollon medical cannabis formulations killing HER2+ breast cancer cells and Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) cells in 3D cell culture as recently announced."</span></p>
<p class="av"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span>Dr.&nbsp;<person>Herbert A. Fritsche</person>, Chief Science Officer of Apollon, and former Professor and Director of Clinical Chemistry at the&nbsp;<org value="ACORN:3366263282" idsrc="xmltag.org">University of&nbsp;Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center</org>, stated</span></span><span>,&nbsp;"These remarkable results demonstrating the ability of the Apollon formulations to directly kill nearly 100% of prostate cancer cells in 3D cell culture provide us independent scientific evidence of the success of these products in pre-clinical testing. Pursuant to the Research &amp; Development and the Retail-Therapeutic medical cannabis licences issued to Apollon Jamaica by the <org>Jamaican Cannabis Licensing Authority</org> (CLA), we intend to make these formulations immediately available to licensed Jamaican physicians experienced in prescribing Apollon products, allowing them to begin immediately treating patients who have prostate cancer in&nbsp;<location value="LC/jm" idsrc="xmltag.org">Jamaica</location>&nbsp;where the companies' formulations are currently available by physician prescription. This will allow us to supplement these impressive laboratory results with clinical data from the treatment of human patients."</span></p>
<p class="av"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span>Commented&nbsp;Mr.&nbsp;<person>Paul Burke</person>, Chairman, and CEO of Apollon Jamaica,&nbsp;</span></span><span>"These Apollon formulation test results on prostate cancer and the plan to immediately begin treatments in&nbsp;<location value="LC/jm" idsrc="xmltag.org">Jamaica</location>&nbsp;are extremely exciting developments for Jamaican men, in part, because traditional chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery cancer treatment protocols are expensive and require a great deal of infrastructure. As a result, many men in&nbsp;<location value="LC/jm" idsrc="xmltag.org">Jamaica</location>&nbsp;and worldwide have gone without treatment or with only limited treatment." The Apollon Jamaica Chairman went on to say, "The Apollon medical cannabis formulations are expected to be comparatively much less expensive, providing an opportunity for more men to have their prostate cancer treated. I look forward to bringing these formulations to market as quickly as possible and in a manner that allows Jamaican men with prostate cancer, as well as men traveling from international locations to&nbsp;<location value="LC/jm" idsrc="xmltag.org">Jamaica</location>&nbsp;as medical tourists for our treatment, to have access to high quality complementary and alternative medical care." &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="av"><span>Apollon and Aion expect to negotiate a joint licence agreement whereby Aion's subsidiary AI Pharmaceuticals Jamaica Limited&nbsp;(AI Pharma) may exclusively license and use Apollon Jamaica's medical cannabis proprietary and intellectual property protected formulations to manufacture&nbsp;products for sale in the US and&nbsp;<location value="LC/ca" idsrc="xmltag.org">Canada</location>,&nbsp;where legally allowed. This intellectual property licence would allow Apollon to benefit from Aion's sales in the US and&nbsp;<location value="LC/ca" idsrc="xmltag.org">Canada</location>, where Apollon Jamaica is unable to sell medical cannabis products under current US and&nbsp;<location value="LC/gb" idsrc="xmltag.org">UK</location>&nbsp;law. In both instances, medical care will be provided by physicians authorized to prescribe and/or recommend medical cannabis medications and treat patients in their jurisdictions.</span></p>
