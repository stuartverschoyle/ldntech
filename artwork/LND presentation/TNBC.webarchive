<p class="ai"><span class="af">Apollon Formulations Kill Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) Cells</span></p>
<p class="aj"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><org value="NEX:APOL" idsrc="xmltag.org">Apollon Formularies plc</org>&nbsp;(AQSE: APOL)</span>&nbsp;("<span style="font-weight: bold;">Apollon</span>"&nbsp;or the&nbsp;"<span style="font-weight: bold;">Company</span>"), a <location value="LC/gb" idsrc="xmltag.org">UK</location> based international pharmaceutical company trading on <org>Aquis Stock Exchange</org>, is pleased to announce that its proprietary medical cannabis formulations were successful in killing triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells in 3D cell cultures in third party independent laboratory testing. This finding is in addition to the results recently announced on <chron>May 18, 2021</chron>, that Apollon formulations were successful in killing HER2+ breast cancer cells. This testing was performed under a joint testing agreement <span style="font-weight: bold;">with Aion Therapeutic Inc.&nbsp;(CSE: AION)&nbsp;("Aion")</span>, a BC based international pharmaceutical company trading on the Canadian Securities Exchange.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aj">Metastatic triple-negative breast cancer is an aggressive form of breast cancer with limited treatment options.¬π With TNBC, the three most common types of receptors known to fuel most breast cancer growth-estrogen, progesterone, and the HER-2/neu gene, are not present in the cancer.¬≤&nbsp; According to <person>Richard Pazdur</person>, M.D., director of the <org>FDA's</org> <org>Oncology Center of Excellence</org> and acting director of the <org>Office of Oncologic Diseases</org> in the <org>FDA's</org> <org value="ACORN:1481714709" idsrc="xmltag.org">Center for Drug Evaluation and Research</org>, has stated "There is intense interest in finding new medications to help treat metastatic triple-negative breast cancer."¬≥&nbsp;</p>
<p class="aj">Triple-negative breast cancer comprises about 10-20% of diagnosed breast cancers and is more likely to affect younger people, those of African descent, Hispanics, and/or people with a BRCA1 gene mutation.‚Å¥ ‚Åµ TNBC accounts for approximately 200,000 cases each year globally.‚Åµ TNBC is associated with worse prognosis, early relapse after standard chemotherapy, a high frequency of metastasis to lung, bones, liver and brain, and a low overall survival compared to other breast cancer subtypes.‚Å∂</p>
<p class="aj">The testing was performed by BIOENSIS, an independent, pre-clinical predictive pharmaceutical testing laboratory. The medical cannabis formulations were developed by&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"><org>Apollon Formularies Jamaica Limited</org> ("Apollon Jamaica").</span></p>
<p class="aj">The testing results showed that Apollon Jamaica's medical cannabis formulations were effective in killing living triple-negative cancer cells directly (direct cytotoxicity). The Apollon medical cannabis formulations killed nearly 100% of the triple negative breast cancer cells in 3D cell cultures. ‚Å∑</p>
<p class="aj"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><person>Stephen D. Barnhill</person>, M.D., CEO of Apollon,&nbsp;commented,</span> "Cannabinoids have been seen to exert 'antitumor' effects by a number of different means, including killing cancer cells directly as well as inhibiting transformed cell growth and tumor metastasis.‚Å∏ Apollon Jamaica, using results from its proprietary artificial intelligence-based analysis on strain genetics, has cultivated and processed certain of its proprietary medical cannabis products with cancer treatment expressly in mind. We are excited that our formulations have been validated via independent laboratory testing to kill both HER2+ and triple-negative breast cancer cells in 3D cell cultures through direct cytotoxicity."</p>
<p class="aj"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Dr.&nbsp;<person>Herbert A. Fritsche</person>, Chief Science Officer of Apollon and former Professor and Director of Clinical Chemistry at the&nbsp;<org value="ACORN:3366263282" idsrc="xmltag.org">University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center</org>, stated</span>,&nbsp;"These remarkable results demonstrating the ability of Apollon formulations to directly kill nearly 100% of triple-negative breast cancer cells in 3D culture provide us independent scientific evidence of the success of these products in pre-clinical testing. Pursuant to the Research &amp; Development and the Retail-Therapeutic medical cannabis licences issued to Apollon Jamaica by the <org>Jamaican Cannabis Licensing Authority</org> (CLA), we intend to make these formulations immediately available to licensed Jamaican physicians experienced in prescribing Apollon products, allowing them to begin immediately treating patients who have triple-negative breast cancer in&nbsp;<location value="LC/jm" idsrc="xmltag.org">Jamaica</location>&nbsp;where the company's formulations are available by physician prescription. This will allow us to supplement these impressive laboratory results with clinical data from the treatment of human patients."</p>
<p class="aj"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Commented&nbsp;Mr.&nbsp;<person>Paul Burke</person>, Chairman and CEO of Apollon Jamaica,&nbsp;</span>"These Apollon formulation test results on TNBC and the plan to immediately begin treatments in&nbsp;<location value="LC/jm" idsrc="xmltag.org">Jamaica</location>&nbsp;are extremely exciting developments for Jamaican women, in part, &nbsp;because Women of African Ancestry (WAA) are disproportionately affected by triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)‚Åπ,Traditional chemotherapy, radiation and surgery cancer treatment protocols are expensive and require a great deal of infrastructure. As a result, many women in&nbsp;<location value="LC/jm" idsrc="xmltag.org">Jamaica</location>&nbsp;and worldwide have gone without treatment or with only limited treatment." The Apollon Jamaica Chairman went on to say, "The Apollon medical cannabis formulations are expected to be comparatively much less expensive, providing an opportunity for more women to have their triple -negative breast cancer treated. I look forward to&nbsp; bringing these formulations to market as quickly as possible and in a manner that allows Jamaican women with triple-negative &nbsp;breast cancer, as well as women traveling from international locations to&nbsp;<location value="LC/jm" idsrc="xmltag.org">Jamaica</location>&nbsp;as medical tourists for our treatment, to have access to high quality complementary and alternative medical care." &nbsp;</p>
<p class="aj">Apollon and Aion expect to negotiate a joint licence agreement whereby Aion's subsidiary AI Pharmaceuticals Jamaica Limited&nbsp; (AI Pharma) may exclusively license and use Apollon Jamaica's medical cannabis proprietary and intellectual property protected formulations to manufacture&nbsp; products for sale in the US and&nbsp;<location value="LC/ca" idsrc="xmltag.org">Canada</location> where legally allowed. This intellectual property licence would allow Apollon to benefit from Aion's sales in the US and&nbsp;<location value="LC/ca" idsrc="xmltag.org">Canada</location>, where Apollon Jamaica is unable to sell medical cannabis products under current US and <location value="LC/gb" idsrc="xmltag.org">UK</location> law. In both instances, medical care will be provided by physicians authorized to prescribe and/or recommend medical cannabis medications and treat patients in their jurisdictions.</p>
<p class="aj">The Directors of the Company take responsibility for this announcement.</p>
<p class="aj"><person>Stephen D. Barnhill</person>, CEO of Apollon, is also the Executive Chair of the Board of Aion Therapeutic Inc.</p>
